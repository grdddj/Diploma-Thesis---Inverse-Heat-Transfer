"""
This script is fetching chosen properties of specified
chemical elements and saving them locally in the form of CSV file.

It starts at the Wikipedia page with the list of all the chemical elements,
loops through them all, visits their dedicated page and draws information
that we want, mainly from the right-side info table.

It is possible to filter these elements at will, right now we include only
metals, all imaginable filters can be included easily
(f.e. atomic number > 20, density < 3000...).

Notice the big amount of try/except blocks, that all do the same thing -
in any exception they skip out current element - therefore this could be all
done in just one block, but this layout leaves room for future custom
error-handling of each possible exception.
