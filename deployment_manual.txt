Transferring python GUI app into executable:
- steps below are created for Anaconda python environment
  (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
1) Create virtual environment:
  - this is done so that we have only needed libraries, and unnecessarily
    do not increase the size of our executable
  conda create -n my_new_env python=3.7
2) Activate virtual environment:
  conda activate my_new_env
3) Install all necessary dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt
4) Install pyinstaller
  pip install pyinstaller
5) Create an executable from the main python file
  - those flags are making sure the console will be hidden and only
    one file will be created, instead of the whole directory
  pyinstaller -y -F -w  "heat_transfer_gui.py"
